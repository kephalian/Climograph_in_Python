## Utlilty for drawing Climographs in Python using Seaborn (Climographs show average temperatures and rainfall on a single graph of a place)
## Climographs are graphical representations of  climate of a place.
## These graphs show Rainfall, Temperature and Humidity of a place.
## This Python script creates the HD Climograph of a place which can be used anywhere.
## I wrote this Python program while drawing Climograph of a botanical reserch I did on Indian Cryptocoryne, I need the Climograph of the place, included in my paper (Not yet published)
#### There are 2 versions
#### 1. Cute Seaborn version [Here](https://github.com/kephalian/Climograph_in_Python/blob/main/Climograph_multiple%20bar%20plot%20with%20seaborn.py)
#### 2. Nice Matplotlib Version [Here](https://github.com/kephalian/Climograph_in_Python/blob/main/climograph_pure_matplot_lib.py)
Please modify the list shown below using your climate data obtained from sites like [Pune climate] (https://en.climate-data.org/asia/india/maharashtra/pune-31/) or this site which I like [Better site for Pune Climate](https://www.weather-atlas.com/en/india/pune-climate)
```
 # set height of bar
 Rain=[1, 2, 9, 6, 14,151, 161, 105, 96, 108, 38, 2]
 Temp=[29.3,32.2, 35,37.3, 36.4,36.4, 25.3,25.3,26.7,28.4,28,28]
 Humi=[44, 36,33,37,51,77,86, 88, 85,71,60,52]
```
Rest of the program is self-explanatory and has comments.
Both achieve same results and HD PNG image is written to your Current Working Directory that you can use in your paper.
#### Geologist, Ecologists, Climatologists, Botanists will find this program useful.
